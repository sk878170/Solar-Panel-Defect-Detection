# Solar-Panel-Defect-Detection

## Overview
The Solar Panel Defect Detection System is a Python-based application designed to detect defects in solar panels. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system aims to enhance the efficiency of solar panel maintenance by identifying issues such as cracks, dirt, hotspots, or other anomalies.

## Features
Automated Defect Detection: Analyze images of solar panels to identify potential defects.
Image Processing: Use advanced image preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and feature extraction.
Machine Learning Models: Train and evaluate models to classify defects.
User-Friendly Interface: Upload images and view results easily.
Reports and Insights: Generate detailed reports on defect locations and types.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks:
1) OpenCV: For image processing.
2) NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3) TensorFlow/PyTorch: For building and training machine learning models.
4) Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
